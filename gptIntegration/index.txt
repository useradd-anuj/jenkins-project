1. Choose a programming language or framework: There are several programming languages and frameworks available to create dynamic web pages such as PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, ReactJS, and more. You need to choose the right one based on your requirements and expertise.

2. Set up the development environment: Once you have chosen the programming language or framework, you need to set up the development environment on your computer.

3. Plan your web page architecture: You need to plan the architecture of your web page such as the layout, design, features, functionalities, and more.

4. Create the web design: You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and responsive design for your web page.

5. Build the back-end: You need to create the back-end of your web page using your chosen programming language or framework. You can use various databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL to store data.

6. Add features and functionalities: You can add interactive features and functionalities such as forms, user authentication, dynamic data display, and more, to make your web page more engaging.

7. Test and deploy: Once you have completed the development of your web page, you need to test it thoroughly to ensure that it is bug-free. After testing, you can deploy it on a server so that it can be accessed by users.

These are the basic steps to create a dynamic web page. However, the process may vary depending on the programming language or framework you choose and the complexity of the web page you want to create.
